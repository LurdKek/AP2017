This is my attempt at mini_ex02 for Aesthetic programming AU

<h2> <b> <i>The three projects of Miniex02</h2> </b> </i>

<b>Glitch-clouds</b> was the first glitch I encountered, trying to make the clouds move along the Y-axis, and reappearing at the beginning at the x-axis with a random account of the y-axis for each "reset" of the x-axis. An error in the code resulted in a glitch that made the clouds bounce randomly amongst the random set interval of coordinates on the y-axis <i>during</i> the progression of the clouds on the x-axis, instead of setting the random placement of the clouds on the y-axis at the beginning only.

<b>Coolglitch</b> was an attempt to implement WEBGL into the code, but somehow (I still don't really know why, and I think it is yet beyond my comprehension of the overall layout of the code, to fully understand why, even if I attempted to "dive into it") made a glitch that removed the background and transformed the Triangle (at the top) into a rotating 3Dobject. Looks cool though.

<b>Landscape</b> is the "final" product, and how I inteded the code to be originally (I later added some extra code, just for the sake of learning).

<h2> <b> <i>My coding process</h2> </b> </i>
My coding excperience has been great. Through a lot of trial end error, I have slowly but steadily learned the basic functionality and structure of p5.js and (I hope) other coding-languages, although latter is in a more general form. My personal "spirit" revolving coding is still strong, and only growing. Set aside the more practical notion af learning to code in an increasingly electronic and computational reality, I also feel enlightened in regard of understanding the impact of codes (i.e. algorithms, syntaxes and values in coding) on our culture and society.

Interesting and relevant indeed!

<h2> <b> <i>What constitutes a program?</h2> </b> </i>
A program is a set of algorithms set to perform a specifik task. These tasks can be very simple or very complex - or anywhere in between the two. Programs also defines the (rising) necessity of interfaces; between humans and programs, as well as between two or more electronic or computational devices.


<h2> <b> <i>The notion of error</h2> </b> </i>
<i>What is error?</i>, well error is a glitch, a wrong code -something that is not supposed to happen. But is error necessarily <b>all bad</b>? 
I would argue that it doesn't have to be. As Tim Barker points out in his text <i> Error, The unforseen, and The emergent 2007</i>, and error kan be an opening for new, unseen potentials; dspcially regarding digital art. An example of this could be the code "collglitch" (further up in this folder). Here an error occured when I attempted to implement WEBGL (for 3D models) into my javascript code. Even though this gave a very unintended result, due to an error in my code, it still transformed my "net.art" into something very cool (and unforseen). To phrase Deleuze I had explored the virtual cloud of unforseen potential.
