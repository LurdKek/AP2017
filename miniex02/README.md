This is my attempt at mini_ex02 for Aesthetic programming AU

<h2> <b> <i>The three projects of Miniex02</h2> </b> </i>

<b>Glitch-clouds</b> was the first glitch I encountered, trying to make the clouds move along the Y-axis, and reappearing at the beginning at the x-axis with a random account of the y-axis for each "reset" of the x-axis. An error in the code resulted in a glitch that made to clouds bounce randomly amongst the y-axis <i>during</i> the progression of the clouds on the x-axis, instead of setting the random placement of the clouds on the y-axis at the beginning only.

<b>Coolglitch</b> was an attempt to implement WEBGL into the code, but somehow (I still don't really know why, and I think it is yet beyond my comprehension of the overall layout of the code, to fully understand why, even if I attempted to "dive into it") made a glitch that removed the background and transformed the Triangle (at the top) into a rotating 3Dobject. Looks cool though.

<b>Landscape</b> is the "final" product, and how I inteded the code to be originally (I later added some extra code, just for the sake of learning).
