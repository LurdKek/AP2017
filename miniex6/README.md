SPLASH: This is an attempt to make some generative art. It is done by "splashing" paint onmto the canvas following three rules: Vellocity, gravity and the number of splashes shooting up at a time.
By time the canvas will get painted completely over, and a refresh of the page is necessary. If i have the time I will add sliders to adjust these three rules, so it is possible to easier see the differnce of the outcome.

I think this program expresses the notion of generativity in a more random way. It doesn't look structured as other pieces of generative art often does, and that is part of the charm.
Generativity doesn't have to be structured, but can be purely random, the different outcoems still very interesting in my oppinion.
