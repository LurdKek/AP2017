<h1>Shiieeet doesn't work - gee, thanks GitHub...</h1>

DOWNLOAD THE .Zip INSTEAD. IT (might) NOT CONTAIN ANY VIRUS.... huehuehue
-It will work via your editor.

<h2>About this API</h2>
The API for this code is taken from openweatherdata.com, and portraits different aspects of the weather. Being busy during this easter, I simply followed Schiffmans video and made my own alterations.

<h2>On API's</h2>
API's are a lot of fun to work with (once you get that shiet to work proberly). As I see it it has a lot of potential.
Also I think it is important (as with most other software) to remember that the API-data is always pulled from somewhere, and going through an interface that may act as a filter.
API-data is not always objective (rarely I would say to some degree)... More later, when I am not this tired...

<h3>Instructions</h3>
1) Type in the city you wanna check weather-data on...
2) <b>The blue bar:</b> Represents humidity and airpressure. The <i>thickness</i> of the bar = <i>humidity</i>; the <i>speed</i> it drops = <i>pressure</i>.
3) <b>The yellow circle aKa the sun:</b> You guessed it - it represents <i>heat</i>.
4) <b>The white ellipses aKa the clouds:</b> Represents how <i>cloudy</i> it is (the more the cloudier); and the speed it moves in represents <i>wind speed</i>.
