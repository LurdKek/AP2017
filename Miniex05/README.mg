This is an attempt to make a tell-tale-rpg, made in collaboration with GitHub user Duendue.
The thought was to play with the thought of materiality on a computer versus on a book, regarding classic tell-tale-rpg's.
The old fashioned way of writing books, also requires a lot of scrolling through pages (back and forth) in the book,
also making it possible to "sneak-peak" on pages that you are not directed to through the books' narrative.
With such a form of tell-tale implemented into an itneractive machine, capable of "hiding away" the parts/choices/pages of the inter-active
tell-tale book, it makes it possible for the writer/narrator to strictly-force constraint the reader as the narrator pleases.

The code is made by "switch statements" and by uploading our text-documents into an assets-folder, from where we made p5.js load
the document and arrange each line into a new piece of an array, that again was linked to the number of the swwitch-cases. 
This aaproach also makes it easier to push new arrays in as a story develops (in the code), and gets longer.
Unfortunately we ended up not using RiTa library for our major project, because we mistakenly thought that some build-in
funtions in native P5-js librarys was native to RiTa.

Therefore I have also uploaded a very simple code, that is using RiTa to change the nouns of a sentence you type in.

These are very text-based so I didn't find it necessary to implement a screenshot.
