<h1>Heartbreaker - asteroids ed.</h1>

I follow Daniel Schiffmans tutorial on asteroids (Link:   ). Then I added a small picture into the asteroid constructor function, and added a function to what happens when the ship is hit by an asteroid: The ship and asteroid sporatically changes colour as long as they touch, when they don't touch, a new, "permanent" colour is added to both the ship and the asteroid.

I also wanted to implement music for the mood, but ended up worrying too mutch about copy-right infringement (NIOAAA)...

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<i>Move around the map using left- and right-arrow to turn the triangular vehicle, and use up-arrow to boost vehicle.
USe spacebar to <b>fire lazers at the asteroids.</b></i>

<h2>On flowcharts</h2>
To me flowcharts does not need to explicitely showcase all functions, events and parameters of the code, but is more usefull in a more conceptual manner; i.e. "mapping" the gerenal ideas of flow and actions of the programme.

A difficulty in this is to understand the code to which you make to flowchart. When, on top of adding a flowchart to ones own code, is making a flowchart to a code, someone else has made - it is a good excersise into understanding a code, that one has not made him-/herself.
