<h2>On API's</h2>
API's are a lot of fun to work with (once you get that shiet to work proberly). As I see it it has a lot of potential.
Also I think it is important (as with most other software) to remember that the API-data is always pulled from somewhere, and going through an interface that may act as a filter.
API-data is not always objective (rarely I would say to some degree)... More later, when I am not this tired...
